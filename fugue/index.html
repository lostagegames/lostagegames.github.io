In psychology, a Fugue is a state of consciousness where a person seems to perform acts in full awareness, but upon recovery, cannot remember the acts performed.</em></p> <p>Fugue: <em>A Psychogenic Game of Creation</em>, is a game of creation and manipulation. You and your opponents are opposing creative forces inside an Artist’s mind. Whether the Artist is a painter, poet, musician, or something else, they’re struggling to create a work, and you must make sure the best ideas win out—<em>yours</em>. You will battle by manipulating the Artist’s Spirit, Imagination, Vision, Depth and Passion into sets of two cards, and by creating Fugues.</p> <p>By using these card sets and Fugues, you will move cards from one area of the Artist’s mind to another, and into your Passion area where they are scored.</p> <p>Your opponent will be trying to move their cards as well, and you must keep that from happening.</p> <p>Fugue is a quick-paced strategy game for one to two (*or more) players.</p> <h1 id="components"><a href="#components" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Components</h1> <p>A Fugue game-set includes:</p> <p>• 2 player boards • 1 deck board</p> <p>• 18 cards • 4 fugue meeples</p> <p>• 2 score cubes • 1 rulebook</p> <h1 id="object-of-the-game"><a href="#object-of-the-game" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Object of the Game</h1> <p>Players will create and use card sets (pairs of cards, called <em>Sets</em>) to move cards in and out of the different areas on the boards.</p> <p>The goal of the game is to get the highest score. This is done by moving cards into your Passion Area. When there are two cards in your Passion Area, they are scored.</p> <h1 id="number-of-players"><a href="#number-of-players" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Number of Players</h1> <p>One Fugue game-set is enough for 1 or 2 player games. More players can be included by adding additional game-sets [ link to section ].</p> <h1 id="overview"><a href="#overview" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h1> <p>There are four areas in the game, each with their own symbol and card type. The card has the same symbol as the area it represents. All the cards and areas on the boards share a symbol. (See Figure 2).
&lt; figure 2 image &gt;
Cards can move into other areas on the boards, even areas that have a different symbol.</p> <p><em>Example: A Vision card doesn’t have to be in the Vision Area, a Depth card can be in the Passion Area, etc.</em></p> <p>Each player has their own Imagination Area (&lt; i_icon &gt;), Vision Area ( &lt; v_icon &gt; ), and Passion Area ( &lt; p_icon&gt; ) marked with the corresponding symbol on their Player Board.</p> <p>The Depth Area ( &lt; d_icon &gt;) and the Deck are on the Deck Board.</p> <p>All of these Areas are located on the Player Boards and Deck Board.</p> <p>&lt; figure 3 image&gt;</p> <p><em>The Player Boards also include reference information at the corners: The Score Track (top-right), the Score Table (bottom-right), Phases of Play (bottom-left), and Fugue Value (top-left).</em></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
