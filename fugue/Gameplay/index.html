In the example below, the player has been dealt a Vision card &lt; v_icon &gt; and a Passion card &lt; p_icon &gt; .
&lt; figure 4 image &gt;</p> <p>During play, you’ll be creating sets of two cards. Sets are made by moving cards into your Vision Area ( v_icon ).</p> <p>At the start of each turn, you will move one card of your choice out of your Imagination Area (&lt; i_icon &gt;) and into your Vision Area (&lt; v_icon &gt;)
&lt; figure 5 image &gt;</p> <p>In Figure 5, the player has chosen to move their Passion card &lt; p_icon &gt; (1).</p> <h2 id="creating-sets"><a href="#creating-sets" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Creating Sets</h2> <p>Once you have placed two cards together in your Vision Area (&lt; v_icon &gt;) they become a Set. (See Figure 6).
&lt; figure 6 image &gt;
You can have up to two Sets in your Vision Area (&lt; v_icon &gt;) at a time (4 cards total).</p> <p>In Figure 6, the player has created the Vision/Passion Set or &lt; v_icon &gt; / &lt; p_icon &gt; .</p> <p>The player decides which card goes on the left or right at the <strong>time the Set is completed</strong>. The order of the cards determines what the Set does. The order cannot be changed later.</p> <h2 id="using-sets"><a href="#using-sets" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Using Sets</h2> <p>As noted earlier, all cards share a symbol with a board area. When you decide to use a Set (you don’t have to use them upon creation), you will move a card from the area matching the <strong>left card’s</strong> symbol into the area matching the <strong>right card’s</strong> symbol.</p> <p><em>Example: If you used the Vision/Passion Set from above, you would select any card that’s in a Vision Area, and move it to a Passion Area.</em></p> <p><em>Note: You can't move a card from the Set you are using</em></p> <p>Sets are used to move cards around the different areas of Fugue. The goal is to eventually move them into your Passion Area where they are scored.</p> <p><em>Example: If you used the Set Imagination/Passion, you would take a card that’s in an Imagination Area and place it in a Passion Area. You move the Set into the Depth Area afterwards.</em></p> <p>A Set can be used to move cards from <strong>your</strong> areas or <strong>your opponent’s</strong> areas.</p> <p><em>Example: If you used the Imagination/Passion Set from the previous example, you would choose a card from your Imagination Area (located on your Player board) or your opponent’s Imagination Area (located on their Player board). You would then move the card into either your Passion Area or your opponent’s Passion Area.</em></p> <h2 id="breaking-sets"><a href="#breaking-sets" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Breaking Sets</h2> <p>Sometimes a Set will let you move a card out of a Vision Area (&lt; v_icon &gt;). If you choose to move a card out of a Vision Area, but the card is already a part of a Set, this will break the Set. The chosen card will move as normal. The other card will be moved into the Depth Area ( &lt; d_icon &gt;).</p> <p><em>Example: You use the Set Vision/Passion. Your opponent has the Set Imagination/Depth in their Vision Area. You choose to move the Imagination card into your Passion Area. The opponent’s Set is broken and the Depth card is moved into the Depth Area.</em></p> <p>Sets are broken and go to the Depth Area (&lt; d_icon &gt;) after use.</p> <p><em>Note: It isn’t always obvious what some Sets do (like &lt; d_icon &gt;/ &lt; d_icon &gt;). For a detailed list with examples, see page 10.</em></p> <h2 id="example-of-play"><a href="#example-of-play" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Example of Play</h2> <p>&lt; example of play image &gt;
<em>It is Player One’s turn and they’ve decided to use the Vision/Passion Set they made earlier <strong>(1)</strong>. They must move a card from a Vision Area into a Passion Area.</em></p> <p><em>Player One could either move the Depth card <strong>(2a)</strong> from their own Vision Area, or they could move the Imagination card <strong>(2b)</strong> from their opponent’s Vision Area.</em></p> <p><em>Player One decides to move their opponent’s Imagination card <strong>(2b)</strong>. They move it into their own Passion Area <strong>(3)</strong>. After use, the Vision/Passion Set <strong>(1)</strong> is broken and the cards are moved into the Depth Area <strong>(4)</strong>.</em></p> <p><em>The player could have moved a card into their opponent’s Passion Area instead <strong>(5)</strong>. Sometimes this is a good idea to keep an opponent from getting a high value pair (moving <strong>2a</strong> would be a better choice than <strong>2b</strong>!).</em></p> <h1 id="scoring"><a href="#scoring" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scoring</h1> <p>Once two cards are in a player’s Passion Area (&lt; p_icon &gt;) they are immediately scored (the order of the cards doesn’t matter).</p> <p>Cards are moved into the Depth Area (&lt; d_icon &gt;) after they are scored.</p> <p>Consult the Score Table on your Player Board to see the value of the card pair (Figure 9).
&lt; Figure 9 image &gt;
After scoring, advance your Score Cube on the Score Track (Figure 10) by that amount.</p> <p>As noted earlier, the order of the cards doesn’t matter for scoring.
&lt; Figure 10 image &gt;
Your score can never go below 0.</p> <p><em>Example: Brian has a Vision &lt; v_icon &gt; card in his Passion Area, and later moves an Imagination &lt; v_icon &gt; card into his Passion Area. He scores 4 points. He advances the Score Cube on his Score Track by 4 and moves the cards into the Depth Area (&lt; d_icon &gt;).</em></p> <p><em>Note: &lt; p_icon &gt; /  &lt; p_icon &gt; is worth -1 points. In that case, you would lose a point and need to move your tracker back.</em></p> <h1 id="empty-deck"><a href="#empty-deck" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Empty Deck</h1> <p>When the deck becomes empty, remove a Spirit card in the Depth Area</p> <p>(&lt; d_icon &gt;) from the game.</p> <p>If there are no Spirit cards in the Depth Area, all players must remove a Spirit card from play if they have one.</p> <p>Next, reshuffle the cards in the Depth Area back into the deck.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
