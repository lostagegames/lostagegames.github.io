Play time: 20 min
Requires: 1 game set</strong></p> <p>In this mode, you will play as the “creative” right hemisphere of the brain battling it out against <em>Lefty</em> the “logical” left hemisphere.</p> <p>This mode plays a bit differently than Standard Fugue, and is explained on page 13.</p> <h2 id="solo-challenge"><a href="#solo-challenge" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Solo Challenge</h2> <p><em>No Players: 1 or cooperative
Play time: 20 min
Requires: 1 game set</em></p> <p>This uses the same rules as Standard Fugue, except you don’t have an opponent! Just use one Player board and the Deck board. Go through the Phases like normal, creating and using Sets. Try to get the highest score you can before the game is over!</p> <p>This is a great way to get familiar with the cards and discover interesting ways to use Sets!</p> <h2 id="left-brain-versus-right-brain-beta"><a href="#left-brain-versus-right-brain-beta" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Left Brain Versus Right Brain (beta)</h2> <p>&lt; Figure 11 image &gt;</p> <p>Set Up.

The board on the right is for you and represents the right, or “creative” hemisphere of the brain.</p> <p>Lefty goes first, because it believes that would be the logical thing to do.</p> <p>You must move cards and take actions for Lefty because you are more creative.</p> <p><strong>Phases</strong></p> <p>You and Lefty take turns until the game is over. On your turn, go through the Phases as normal (page 7). Lefty has its own Phases explained below.</p> <p><strong>“Lefty the AI” Phases of a Turn</strong></p> <p>#1 Imagination Phase</p> <p>Lefty moves the <em><strong>highest value</strong></em> card (listed below) from its Imagination Area (&lt; i_icon &gt;) into its Vision Area (&lt; v_icon &gt;). The card goes into the left-hand side of the Vision Area first. When Lefty completes a Set, it will move the <em><strong>lowest value</strong></em> card from its Imagination Area to complete the Set (this card goes on the right). Lefty makes Sets when it can, and makes them from left to right.</p> <p>Card Value</p> <p>Spirit (Highest value card if Lefty has <em>no</em> Fugue in play)
Imagination
Vision
Depth
Passion
Spirit (Lowest value card if Lefty has a Fugue in play)</p> <p>#2 Fugue Phase: Lefty will create and use a Set to make a Fugue first thing if it can. If Lefty already has a Fugue, skip this Phase.</p> <p>#3 Passion Phase: Lefty will use a Set if it has one. It will move the most valuable card available into its Passion Area (&lt; p_icon &gt; ) if it can. It won’t use Sets if there are no targets available, but will use Sets even on low-value targets if they are available. Fugues work the same with Spirit cards for Lefty. If there are multiple options, you decide what Lefty does.</p> <p>#4. Spirit Phase: Lefty draws back up to two cards in its Imagination Area ( &lt; i_icon &gt;) from the deck. End of turn.</p> <p>Lefty scores <strong>double</strong> points for all card pairs, but not Fugues (if that’s too easy or difficult, try <strong>single</strong> or <strong>triple</strong> points!)</p> <p>Same victory conditions apply as in Standard Fugue. Lefty wins ties!</p> <p>Victory</p> <p>When the deck becomes empty, remove a Spirit card in the Depth Area () from the game. Reshuffle the cards in the Depth Area () back into the deck. After the 4th Spirit card has been removed from the game, the game is over the next time the deck becomes empty. (See page x).</p> <p>Note: If you don’t have any cards in your Imagination Area () at the start of your turn, you will have to skip “#2 Imagination Phase”. Go through the phases and draw back up to two cards during the Spirit Phase (#5) like normal.</p> <p>Note: It’s possible to have more than two cards in your Imagination Area</p> <p>() due to using certain Sets. Move one card into the Vision Area during the Imagination Phase (#2) like normal.</p> <p>Phases of a Turn</p> <p>Before play, set up the game as detailed in Setup on page 1.</p> <p>The last person to visit an art museum is Player One.</p> <p>#1. Deal two cards face-up into each player’s Imagination Area ().</p> <p>#2. Player One starts their turn.</p> <p>Player’s take turns until the game is over. Each turn has five parts, called phases. Some things can only be done during certain phases. Go through the phases in order. Some phases are optional (they can be skipped).</p> <p>#1 Vision Phase (optional)</p> <p>Player One can use a Set they already have in their Vision Area (). Sets are moved into the Depth Area () after use.</p> <p>#2 Imagination Phase</p> <p>Player One moves one (and only one) card from their Imagination Area () into their Vision Area ().</p> <p>They may start a new Set or complete an old Set.</p> <p>(There is only room for two Sets per Vision Area (4 cards total). Move an old Set into the Depth Area () to make room for the new card if needed.)</p> <p>#3. Second Vision Phase (optional): Player One can use any Sets they’ve made this turn. Sets are moved into the Depth Area () after use.</p> <p>#4 Depth Phase (optional): Player One can move a card from their Imagination Area () into the Depth Area ().</p> <p>#5. Spirit Phase: Player One draws back up to two cards in their Imagination Area () from the deck.</p> <p>Player Two starts their turn.</p> <p>Victory</p> <p>When the deck becomes empty, remove a Spirit card in the Depth Area</p> <p>() from the game. If there are no Spirit cards in the Depth Area, all players must remove a Spirit card from play if they have one. Reshuffle the cards in the Depth Area back into the deck. After the 4th Spirit card has been removed from the game, the game is over the next time the deck becomes empty. (See page 10).</p> <p>Note: If you don’t have any cards in your Imagination Area () at the start of your turn, you will skip “Phase #2 Imagination Phase”. Certain Sets can cause this to happen.</p> <p>Note: It’s possible to have more than two cards in your Imagination Area</p> <p>() due to using certain Sets. Move one card into the Vision Area during the Imagination Phase (#2) like normal.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
